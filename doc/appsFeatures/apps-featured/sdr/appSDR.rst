Connecting the cables
---------------------

1. Set IN1 jumper to the middle of STEMlab 125-14 
2. Mount impedance to IN1, connect the other side with C25 model 
3. Connect OUT1 with C25 module
4. Connect Rx bypass filters 
5. Connect antenna cable 
6. Connect control cable 
7. Connect power cable to DC 13.8V power supply
8. Turn ON / power your STEMlab board

.. note::
	
	Charly25ac should be powered by DC 13.8V Power Supply that can provide at least 4 A of constant power. 
	Make sure that is turned off and then use DC power cord with Anderson Power Pole™ connector **(1)** to connect it with Charly25ac. 
	RED wire is positive (+) while BLACK wire is negative (-), double check to not mix the colours or polarity! 
	Don’t turn on the power supply yet.

9. Put STEMlab in SDR mode:

10. Make sure your computer is connected to same local area network as STEMlab 
11. Open your WEB browser and connect to your STEMlab (http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/quickStart/first.html)

12. Start SDR HPSDR web application first.

STEMlab is now ready to connet with Power SDR.

.. note:: 

	Exiting this SDR WEB application will close the connection to Power SDR.

.. tip::
	Optionaly you can connect MIDI controller to your PC. MIDI controller can be used to control radio software parameters like frequency with physical knobs.
